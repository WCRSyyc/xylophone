# WCRS Xylophone

This is the github pages site for the Xylophone that is part of the
Western Canadian Robotics Society display case.

The Xylophone uses a set of piezo vibration sensors mounted in laser cut acrylic rectangles arranged to visually simulated the look of a normal Xylophone.  The sensors are connected to an Ardiuno, which is programmed to generate a different fixed length tone when a an impact is detected on each sensor.
